> Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function, and single purpose aggregation methods.

## Aggregation Pipeline

[Aggregation Pipeline](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/#aggregation-pipeline)

> MongoDB’s aggregation framework is modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

> The most basic pipeline stages provide filters that operate like queries and document transformations that modify the form of the output document.

> Other pipeline operations provide tools for grouping and sorting documents by specific field or fields as well as tools for aggregating the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. In addition, pipeline stages can use operators for tasks such as calculating the average or concatenating a string.

> The pipeline provides efficient data aggregation using native operations within MongoDB, and is the preferred method for data aggregation in MongoDB.

> The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into aggregated results.

Notice that here we just received all of the matching 10 documents since cust_id is unique in each record.

Let us create a couple of documents with same id now and try again:

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
...     { $match: { status: "A" } },
...     { $group: { _id: "$cust_id", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
... ])
{ "_id" : "1000091797795367", "total" : 892.95 }
{ "_id" : "1000030934189763", "total" : 72.03 }
{ "_id" : "1000061184481622", "total" : 406.77 }
{ "_id" : "1000017100593284", "total" : 939.15 }
{ "_id" : "1000032394277703", "total" : 446.45 }
{ "_id" : "1000068199381696", "total" : 737.54 }
{ "_id" : "1000002686460521", "total" : 580.83 }
{ "_id" : "1000076848558193", "total" : 274.04 }
{ "_id" : "1000015417137497", "total" : 685.98 }
{ "_id" : "1000021996040483", "total" : 252.43 }
> db.orders.insertMany([
... { _id: new ObjectId(), cust_id: "1000015417137497", amount: 50.25, status: "A" },
... { _id: new ObjectId(), cust_id: "1000015417137497", amount: 25.75, status: "A" },
... { _id: new ObjectId(), cust_id: "1000015417137497", amount: 75.25, status: "A" }
... ])
{
	"acknowledged" : true,
	"insertedIds" : [
		ObjectId("5c9bafc5f65647b492473840"),
		ObjectId("5c9bafc5f65647b492473841"),
		ObjectId("5c9bafc5f65647b492473842")
	]
}
> db.orders.aggregate([
... { $match: { status: "A" } },
... { $group: { _id: "$cust_id", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
... ])
{ "_id" : "1000091797795367", "total" : 892.95 }
{ "_id" : "1000030934189763", "total" : 72.03 }
{ "_id" : "1000061184481622", "total" : 406.77 }
{ "_id" : "1000017100593284", "total" : 939.15 }
{ "_id" : "1000032394277703", "total" : 446.45 }
{ "_id" : "1000068199381696", "total" : 737.54 }
{ "_id" : "1000002686460521", "total" : 580.83 }
{ "_id" : "1000076848558193", "total" : 274.04 }
{ "_id" : "1000015417137497", "total" : 837.23 }
{ "_id" : "1000021996040483", "total" : 252.43 }
>
```

We added 2 more documents for the $cust_id of "1000015417137497" and now we should get a different total for the 4 documents in total.

Notice that now we have an aggregation for the $cust_id of "1000015417137497" and a different total and we can compute this total manually to verify as:

```
685.98 + 50.25 + 25.75 + 75.25 = 837.23
```

#### MongoDB Aggregation with Zipcode dataset

[Zipcode Dataset MongoDB](http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json)

Please run the following mongoimport command to import the zipcode dataset:

```bash
mongoimport datasets/zips.json -c zipcodes -d nosql_workshop
```

![images/mongoimport-zips](../images/mongoimport-zips.png)

###### Return States with Populations above 10 Million

[Return States with Populations above 10 Million](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-zip-code-data-set/#return-states-with-populations-above-10-million)

Let us run an aggregation query that returns state that have populations > 10 million:

![images/mongodb-aggregation-query-pop-millions](../images/mongodb-aggregation-query-pop-millions.png)

*Here is a breakdown according to MongoDB docs!*

> The $group stage groups the documents of the zipcode collection by the state field, calculates the totalPop field for each state, and outputs a document for each unique state.

> The new per-state documents have two fields: the _id field and the totalPop field. The _id field contains the value of the state; i.e. the group by field. The totalPop field is a calculated field that contains the total population of each state. To calculate the value, $group uses the $sum operator to add the population field (pop) for each state.

> The $match stage filters these grouped documents to output only those documents whose totalPop value is greater than or equal to 10 million. The $match stage does not alter the matching documents but outputs the matching documents unmodified.

Here is an equivalent SQL statement according to the docs:

```sql
SELECT state, SUM(pop) AS totalPop
FROM zipcodes
GROUP BY state
HAVING totalPop >= (10*1000*1000)
```

###### Return Average City Population by State

[Return Average City Population by State](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-zip-code-data-set/#return-average-city-population-by-state)

>The following aggregation operation returns the average populations for cities in each state:

![images/mongodb-aggregation-return-avg-city-by-pop](../images/mongodb-aggregation-return-avg-city-by-pop.png)

> In this example, the aggregation pipeline consists of the $group stage followed by another $group stage:

* The first $group stage groups the documents by the combination of city and state, uses the $sum expression to calculate the population for each combination, and outputs a document for each city and state combination.

* A second $group stage groups the documents in the pipeline by the _id.state field (i.e. the state field inside the _id document), uses the $avg expression to calculate the average city population (avgCityPop) for each state, and outputs a document for each state.

###### Return Largest and Smallest Cities by State

[Return Largest and Smallest Cities by State](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-zip-code-data-set/#return-largest-and-smallest-cities-by-state)

The following aggregation operation returns the smallest and largest cities by population for each state:

```js
db.zipcodes.aggregate([
   { $group:
      {
        _id: { state: "$state", city: "$city" },
        pop: { $sum: "$pop" }
      }
   },
   { $sort: { pop: 1 } },
   { $group:
      {
        _id : "$_id.state",
        biggestCity:  { $last: "$_id.city" },
        biggestPop:   { $last: "$pop" },
        smallestCity: { $first: "$_id.city" },
        smallestPop:  { $first: "$pop" }
      }
   },

  // the following $project is optional, and
  // modifies the output format.

  { $project:
    { _id: 0,
      state: "$_id",
      biggestCity:  { name: "$biggestCity",  pop: "$biggestPop" },
      smallestCity: { name: "$smallestCity", pop: "$smallestPop" }
    }
  }
])
```

Here is a screenshot with the results from the aggregate query:

![images/mongodb-aggregation-return-largest-and-smallest-city-by-state](../images/mongodb-aggregation-return-largest-and-smallest-city-by-state.png)

> In this example, the aggregation pipeline consists of a $group stage, a $sort stage, another $group stage, and a $project stage:

* The first $group stage groups the documents by the combination of the city and state, calculates the sum of the pop values for each combination, and outputs a document for each city and state combination.

* The $sort stage orders the documents in the pipeline by the pop field value, from smallest to largest; i.e. by increasing order. This operation does not alter the documents.

* The next $group stage groups the now-sorted documents by the _id.state field (i.e. the state field inside the _id document) and outputs a document for each state. The stage also calculates the following four fields for each state. Using the $last expression, the $group operator creates the biggestCity and biggestPop fields that store the city with the largest population and that population. Using the $first expression, the $group operator creates the smallestCity and smallestPop fields that store the city with the smallest population and that population.

* The final $project stage renames the _id field to state and moves the biggestCity, biggestPop, smallestCity, and smallestPop into biggestCity and smallestCity embedded documents.

###### User Preference Data

*All of this comes from official docs at [Aggregation with user preference data](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-with-user-preference-data/#aggregation-with-user-preference-data)*

Let us create a user preference collection using the following script in the workshop:

```bash
mongo scripts/create-userprefs-collection.js
```

*Now we can run the following aggregate query in MongoDB:*

```js
db.userstats.aggregate([     
    { $project: { name: { $concat: [ { $toUpper: "$firstName" }, " ", { $toUpper: "$lastName" }]}} },       
	{ $sort : { name : 1 } } 
])
```

Here is the aggregation query request which concatenates the firstName and lastName fields and transforms them into uppercase onto a new field called name and sort by the name field

![images/mongodb-aggregation-userprefs-concat-upper](../images/mongodb-aggregation-userprefs-concat-upper.png)

All documents from the users collection pass through the pipeline, which consists of the following operations:

* The $project operator:
  * creates a new field called name.
  * converts the value of the _id to upper case, with the $toUpper operator. Then the $project creates a new field, named name to hold this value.
  * suppresses the id field. $project will pass the _id field by default, unless explicitly suppressed.

* The $sort operator orders the results by the name field.

###### Return Usernames Ordered by Join Month

[Return Usernames Ordered by Join Month](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-with-user-preference-data/#return-usernames-ordered-by-join-month)

> The following aggregation operation returns user names sorted by the month they joined. This kind of aggregation could help generate membership renewal notices.

![images/mongodb-aggregation-join-month](../images/mongodb-aggregation-join-month.png)

Notice here that we added a field called month_joined using $project

The pipeline passes all documents in the users collection through the following operations:

* The $project operator:
  * Creates two new fields: month_joined and name.
  * Suppresses the id from the results. The aggregate() method includes the _id, unless explicitly suppressed.

* The $month operator converts the values of the joined field to integer representations of the month. 
  * Then the $project operator assigns those values to the month_joined field.

* The $sort operator sorts the results by the month_joined field.

###### Return Total Number of Joins per Month

[Return Total Number of Joins per Month](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-with-user-preference-data/#return-total-number-of-joins-per-month)

> The following operation shows how many people joined each month of the year. You might use this aggregated data for recruiting and marketing strategies.

![images/mongodb-aggregation-total-number-of-joins-per-month](../images/mongodb-aggregation-total-number-of-joins-per-month.png)

The pipeline passes all documents in the users collection through the following operations:

* The $project operator creates a new field called month_joined.

* The $month operator converts the values of the joined field to integer representations of the month. Then the $project operator assigns the values to the month_joined field.

* The $group operator collects all documents with a given month_joined value and counts how many documents there are for that value. Specifically, for each unique value, $group creates a new “per-month” document with two fields:
  * _id, which contains a nested document with the month_joined field and its value.
  * number, which is a generated field. The $sum operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing the given month_joined value.

* The $sort operator sorts the documents created by $group according to the contents of the month_joined field.

###### Return the Five Most Common "Likes"

> The following aggregation collects top five most "liked" activities in the data set. This type of analysis could help inform planning and future development.

![images/mongodb-aggregation-return-5-most-common-likes](../images/mongodb-aggregation-return-5-most-common-likes.png)

The pipeline begins with all documents in the users collection, and passes these documents through the following operations:

* The $unwind operator separates each value in the likes array, and creates a new version of the source document for every element in the array.

* The $group operator collects all documents with the same value for the likes field and counts each grouping. With this information, $group creates a new document with two fields:
  * _id, which contains the likes value.
  * number, which is a generated field. The $sum operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing the given likes value.

* The $sort operator sorts these documents by the number field in reverse order.

* The $limit operator only includes the first 5 result documents.

#### Single Purpose Aggregation Operations

> MongoDB also provides db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount(), db.collection.count() and db.collection.distinct().

> All of these operations aggregate documents from a single collection. While these operations provide simple access to common aggregation processes, they lack the flexibility and capabilities of the aggregation pipeline and map-reduce.

#### Pipeline

[Pipeline](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/#pipeline)

> The MongoDB aggregation pipeline consists of stages. Each stage transforms the documents as they pass through the pipeline. Pipeline stages do not need to produce one output document for every input document; e.g., some stages may generate new documents or filter out documents. Pipeline stages can appear multiple times in the pipeline.

#### Pipeline Expressions

[Pipeline Expressions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/#pipeline-expressions)

> Some pipeline stages take a pipeline expression as the operand. Pipeline expressions specify the transformation to apply to the input documents. Expressions have a document structure and can contain other expression.

> Pipeline expressions can only operate on the current document in the pipeline and cannot refer to data from other documents: expression operations provide in-memory transformation of documents.

> Generally, expressions are stateless and are only evaluated when seen by the aggregation process with one exception: accumulator expressions.


## Map-Reduce

*All of the examples stem from the official docs at [Map Reduce Examples](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/#map-reduce-examples)

[Map-Reduce](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/#map-reduce)

> MongoDB also provides map-reduce operations to perform aggregation. In general, map-reduce operations have two phases: a map stage that processes each document and emits one or more objects for each input document, and reduce phase that combines the output of the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a finalize stage to make final modifications to the result. Like other aggregation operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to select the input documents as well as sort and limit the results.

> Map-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce operations, as well as the optional finalize operation. While the custom JavaScript provide great flexibility compared to the aggregation pipeline, in general, map-reduce is less efficient and more complex than the aggregation pipeline.

> Map-reduce can operate on a sharded collection. Map-reduce operations can also output to a sharded collection. See Aggregation Pipeline and Sharded Collections and Map-Reduce and Sharded Collections for details.

> Map-reduce is a data processing paradigm for condensing large volumes of data into useful aggregated results. For map-reduce operations, MongoDB provides the mapReduce database command.

Let us create a collection called ordersv2 with the following mongo script:

```bash
mongo scripts/create-ordersv2-collection.js
```

###### Return the Total Price Per Customer

[Return the Total Price Per Customer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/#return-the-total-price-per-customer)

Let us run the following query to return the total price per customer:

```js
"use strict";

let db = connect("localhost:27017/nosql_workshop");

let mapFunc = function() {
    emit(this.cust_id, this.price);
};

let reduceFunc = function(keyCustId, valuesPrices) {
    return Array.sum(valuesPrices);
};

db.ordersv2.mapReduce(
    mapFunc,
    reduceFunc,
    { out: "map_reduce_example" }
);
```

We can run this query and create a new collection called "map_reduce_example" with the following command:

```bash
mongo scripts/map-reduce-total-price-per-customer.js
```

###### Calculate Order and Total Quantity with Average Quantity Per Item

[Calculate Order and Total Quantity with Average Quantity Per Item](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/#calculate-order-and-total-quantity-with-average-quantity-per-item)

Here is the corresponding example mongo script:

```js
"use strict";

let db = connect("localhost:27017/nosql_workshop");

let mapFunc = function() {
    this.items.forEach(function(item) {
        var value = {
            count: 1,
            qty: item.qty
        };
        emit(item.sku, value);
    });
};

let reduceFunc = function(keyCustId, countObjVals) {
    let reducedVal = {
        count: 0,
        qty: 0
    };

    for (let index = 0; index < countObjVals.length; index++) {
        reducedVal.count += countObjVals[index].count;
        reducedVal.qty += countObjVals[index].qty;
    }

    return reducedVal;
};

let finalizeFunc = function(key, reducedVal) {
    reducedVal.avg = reducedVal.qty / reducedVal.count;
    
    return reducedVal;
}

const query = {
    out: {
        merge: "map_reduce_example"
    },
    query: {
        ord_date: {
            $gt: new Date('01/01/2012')
        },
        finalize: finalizeFunc
    }
};

db.ordersv2.mapReduce(
    mapFunc,
    reduceFunc,
    query
);
```

You can run this example with:

```bash
mongo scripts/calculate_order_and_total_quantity_with_average_quantity_per_item.js
```

#### Perform incremental map reduce example

Let us create a new collection based on the example on [Perform Incremental Map Reduce in MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce/)

Please run the following script to create the sessions collection:

```bash
mongo scripts/create-sessions-collection.js
```

Let us look at the following example that computes map reduce with sessions collection:

```js
"use strict";

let db = connect("localhost:27017/nosql_workshop");

let mapFunc = function() {
    let key = this.userid;
    let value = {
        user_id: this.user_id,
        total_time: this.length,
        count: 1,
        avg_time: 0
    };
    emit(key, value);
};

let reduceFunc = function(key, values) {
    let reducedObject = {
        user_id: key,
        total_time: 0,
        count: 0,
        avg_time: 0
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
        reducedObject.total_time += values[i].total_time;
        reducedObject.count += values[i].count;
    }

    return reducedObject;
};

let finalizeFunc = function(key, reducedVal) {
    if (reducedVal.count > 0) {
        reducedVal.avg_time = reducedVal.total_time / reducedVal.count;
    }

    return reducedVal;
}

let query = {
    out: "session_stat",
    finalize: finalizeFunc
};

db.sessions.mapReduce(
    mapFunc,
    reduceFunc,
    query
);
```

Let us say at the end of the day the following entries are added to the sessions collection:

```js
db.sessions.insertMany([
    { user_id: "9cc42fe7-832b-492c-812b-08663f559ad9", ts: ISODate("2018-11-18T19:59:40.130Z"), length: 47 },
    { user_id: "868e6fd4-e962-48ae-b286-7e358a7f765d", ts: ISODate("2018-09-26T11:00:19.750Z"), length: 84 },
    { user_id: "e52559ad-773e-4c45-84d5-d712e6a86c71", ts: ISODate("2019-01-11T14:04:14.295Z"), length: 48 },
    { user_id: "b3b75da6-68ce-4b14-8841-363ac286ac8e", ts: ISODate("2019-03-08T16:24:18.058Z"), length: 32 },
    { user_id: "fb540a5a-ac56-4557-804e-e8226db05dba", ts: ISODate("2018-12-04T17:02:30.487Z"), length: 31 },
    { user_id: "2084d803-ae55-4b59-b7ef-9ad1b2339a2a", ts: ISODate("2019-01-09T06:54:58.016Z"), length: 61 }
])
```

> At the end of the day, perform incremental map-reduce on the sessions collection, but use the query field to select only the new documents. Output the results to the collection session_stat, but reduce the contents with the results of the incremental map-reduce:

Now our query would look like this for the end of day computation:

```js
let query = {
    out: {
        reduce: "session_stat"
    },
    query: {
        ts: {
            $gt: ISODate('2011-11-05 00:00:00')
        }
    },
    finalize: finalizeFunc
};

```

Look at *scripts/incremental_map_reducev2.js* for more details.

###### Troubleshoot the Map Function

[Troubleshoot the Map Function](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/troubleshoot-map-function/)

> The map function is a JavaScript function that associates or "maps" a value with a key and emits the key and value pair during a map-reduce operation.

Look at us look the following example to troubleshoot map function:

```js
"use strict";

let db = connect("localhost:27017/nosql_workshop");

let map = function() {
    emit(this.cust_id, this.price);
};

let emit = function(key, value) {
    print("emit");
    print(`key: ${key} value: ${tojson(value)}`);

};

let myDoc = db.ordersv2.findOne({ price: { $gt: 300 } });
map.apply(myDoc);

// Now invoke map with multiple documents
let myCursor = db.ordersv2.find({ price: { $gt: 300 } });

while (myCursor.hasNext()) {
    let doc = myCursor.next();
    print(`document _id = ${tojson(doc._id)}`);
    map.apply(doc);
    print();
}
```

###### Troubleshoot the Reduce Function

> The reduce function is a JavaScript function that "reduces" to a single object all the values associated with a particular key during a map-reduce operation. The reduce function must meet various requirements. This tutorial helps verify that the reduce function meets the following criteria:

Look at the following script that uses the examples from [Troubleshoot reduce function](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/troubleshoot-reduce-function/).

###### Aggregation Stages Table Reference for db.collection.aggregate

[](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#stages-db-collection-aggregate)

| Aggregation Stage | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| $addFields | Adds new fields to documents. Similar to $project, $addFields reshapes each document in the stream; specifically, by adding new fields to output documents that contain both the existing fields from the input documents and the newly added fields. | 
| $bucket | Categorizes incoming documents into groups, called buckets, based on a specified expression and bucket boundaries. | 
| $bucketAuto | Categorizes incoming documents into a specific number of groups, called buckets, based on a specified expression. Bucket boundaries are automatically determined in an attempt to evenly distribute the documents into the specified number of buckets. | 
| $collStats | Returns statistics regarding a collection or view. | 
| $count | Returns a count of the number of documents at this stage of the aggregation pipeline. | 
| $facet | Processes multiple aggregation pipelines within a single stage on the same set of input documents. Enables the creation of multi-faceted aggregations capable of characterizing data across multiple dimensions, or facets, in a single stage. | 
| $geoNear | Returns an ordered stream of documents based on the proximity to a geospatial point. Incorporates the functionality of $match, $sort, and $limit for geospatial data. The output documents include an additional distance field and can include a location identifier field. | 
| $graphLookup | Performs a recursive search on a collection. To each output document, adds a new array field that contains the traversal results of the recursive search for that document. | 
| $group | Groups input documents by a specified identifier expression and applies the accumulator expression(s), if specified, to each group. Consumes all input documents and outputs one document per each distinct group. The output documents only contain the identifier field and, if specified, accumulated fields. | 
| $indexStats | Returns statistics regarding the use of each index for the collection. |

| $redact | Reshapes each document in the stream by restricting the content for each document based on information stored in the documents themselves. Incorporates the functionality of $project and $match. Can be used to implement field level redaction. For each input document, outputs either one or zero documents. | 
| $replaceRoot | Replaces a document with the specified embedded document. The operation replaces all existing fields in the input document, including the _id field. Specify a document embedded in the input document to promote the embedded document to the top level. |
| $sample | Randomly selects the specified number of documents from its input. | 
| $skip | Skips the first n documents where n is the specified skip number and passes the remaining documents unmodified to the pipeline. For each input document, outputs either zero documents (for the first n documents) or one document (if after the first n documents). | 
| $sort | Reorders the document stream by a specified sort key. Only the order changes; the documents remain unmodified. For each input document, outputs one document. | 
| $sortByCount | Groups incoming documents based on the value of a specified expression, then computes the count of documents in each distinct group. | 
| $unwind | Deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element. Each output document replaces the array with an element value. For each input document, outputs n documents where n is the number of array elements and can be zero for an empty array. |

![images/mongodb-aggregation-uniq-custid-sum-and-return-gt-250](../images/mongodb-aggregation-uniq-custid-sum-and-return-gt-250.png)

*Notice that we only return documents that have total greater than 250.*

#### For each unique cust_id, sum the corresponding line item qty fields associated with the orders.

```js
db.ordersv2.aggregate([
   { $unwind: "$items" },
   {
     $group: {
        _id: "$cust_id",
        qty: { $sum: "$items.qty" }
     }
   }
])
```

This query is the equivalent to the following SQL command: 

```sql
SELECT cust_id,
       SUM(li.qty) as qty
FROM orders o,
     order_lineitem li
WHERE li.order_id = o.id
GROUP BY cust_id
```

#### Count the number of distinct cust_id, ord_date groupings. Excludes the time portion of the date.

```js
db.ordersv2.aggregate([
   {
     $group: {
        _id: {
           cust_id: "$cust_id",
           ord_date: {
              month: { $month: "$ord_date" },
              day: { $dayOfMonth: "$ord_date" },
              year: { $year: "$ord_date"}
           }
        }
     }
   },
   {
     $group: {
        _id: null,
        count: { $sum: 1 }
     }
   }
])
```

This query is the equivalent to the following SQL command: 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT cust_id,
             ord_date
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY cust_id,
               ord_date)
      as DerivedTable
```

## MongoDB Aggregation Practice Exercises

#### Aggregation Exercise 1

Please insert a new collection called employees in the mongo shell like this:

```bash
use nosql_workshop

dept = ["IT", "Engineering", "QA", "Data", "Product"];

for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) { 
   db.employees.insert({ 
      id: i, 
      empId: 'empId_' + i, 
      deptName: dept[Math.round(Math.random() * 4)], 
      experience: Math.round(Math.random() * 30) 
   }); 
}
```

This insert 100 documents to the employees collection

Please write a mongodb aggregation has the following fields:

* DEPARTMENT
* newExperience

*Please make sure to make the field 'DEPARTMENT' is in all caps with mongodb.*

*Also use the experience field and add one to it.*

*Hint look at the following documentation: [Aggregation Pipeline Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)

<details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <pre>
   db.employees.aggregate([ 
      { 
         $project: { 
            _id: 0, 
            Department: { $toUpper: '$deptName' }, 
            newExperience: { $add: [ '$experience', 1 ] } 
         } 
      } 
   ])
   </pre>
</details>

#### Aggregation Exercise 2

Please use the employees collection and now only get employees that are part of engineering using aggregations:

*Hint: you will need to add another pipeline stage and find the match.*

Please look at the [Aggregation Pipeline Stages Table](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/#alphabetical-listing-of-stages)

<details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <pre>
   db.employees.aggregate([ 
      { 
         $project: { 
            _id: 0, 
            Department: { $toUpper: '$deptName' }, 
            newExperience: { $add: [ '$experience', 1 ] } 
         } 
      },
      {
         $match: {
            'Department': 'ENGINEERING'
         }
      } 
   ])
   </pre>
</details>

#### Aggregation Exercise 3

Please use the employees collection and group the number of employees by department and their respective years of experience.

The fields returned should be:

* _id 
   * Should be a document with Department and yearsExperience 
* numEmployees should count the number of employees

Look at the following aggregate operators to count all the employees: [Aggregate Operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/)

<details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <pre>
   db.employees.aggregate([ 
      { 
         $group:  { 
            _id: { 'Department': '$deptName', 'yearsExperience': '$experience' }, 
            numEmployees: { $sum: 1 } 
         } 
      } 
   ])
   </pre>
</details>

#### Aggregation Exercise 4

Please reuse the aggregate query in exercise 3 but now sort using the Department field in the _id field:

<details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <pre>
   db.employees.aggregate([ 
    { 
        $group:  { 
            _id: { 'Department': '$deptName', 'yearsExperience': '$experience' }, 
            numEmployees: { $sum: 1 } 
        }
    },
    {
        $sort: {
            _id: 1
        }
    }
   ])
   </pre>
</details>

#### Aggregation Exercise 5

Please reuse the aggregate query in exercise 4 but use the $skip and $limit aggregation pipeline stage to skip the first 5 and limit to 2 records

<details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <pre>
   db.employees.aggregate([ 
    { 
        $group:  { 
            _id: { 'Department': '$deptName', 'yearsExperience': '$experience' }, 
            numEmployees: { $sum: 1 } 
        }
    },
    {
        $sort: {
            _id: 1
        }
    },
    {
       $skip: 5
    },
    {
       $limit: 2
    }
   ])
   </pre>
</details>
