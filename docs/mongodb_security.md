#### Security Checklist

Please read the [MongoDB Security Checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/)

#### Enable Access Control

Please read the section [Enable Access Control](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/enable-authentication/)

#### Authentication

Please read the section [Authentication](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authentication/)

#### Role-Based Access Control

Please read the section [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/authorization/)

[RBAC Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

> In computer systems security, role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to unauthorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees, and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

> Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations[citation needed]. RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.

#### TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption)

Please read the section on [TLS/SSL](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-transport-encryption/)

#### Auditing

Please read the section on [Auditing](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/auditing/)

#### Security Hardening

Please read the section on [Security Hardening](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-hardening/)

#### Implement Field Level Redaction

Please read the section on [Field Level Redaction](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/implement-field-level-redaction/)

#### Security Reference

Please read the [Security Reference Section](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/security/)

#### Create a Vulnerability Report

Please read the [Vulnerability Report Section](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report/)
